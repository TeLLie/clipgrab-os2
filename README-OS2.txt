Was can I do with ClipGrab?
With ClipGrab you can download online clips from many sites with just some clicks and then 
automatically convert them into "usable" files. This way, you can watch your favourite clips 
again and again wherever and whenever you like. And since ClipGrab can also save your videos as 
audio files, you can also put them on your mp3 player if you like.

How does that work?
Downloading a video with ClipGrab is pretty easy. Here it's demonstrated with a YouTube video:

    Copy the link from your browser's address bar. For Youtube it should be something like this:
    http://youtube.com/watch?v=MC18FQHo0Kk
    Then paste the link into one of ClipGrab's input fields (right click->Paste | [Ctrl]+[V]).
    Choose your target format and click "Grab this clip!"

However, ClipGrab is not limited to these sites as many more sites are supported "unofficially" 
through the automatic site-recognition of ClipGrab - just try it! By the way, ClipGrab can also 
download HD videos from sites which have support for high definition.
