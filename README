#Compiling ClipGrab

Pre-compiled packages for ClipGrab are available on https://clipgrab.org
But compiling ClipGrab is really easy!

##Prerequisites

You need to install the Qt4 developer libraries in order to compile the program.

On Ubuntu and Debian-based system, you can install the necessary libraries like this:
sudo apt install libqt4-dev libqt4-bin libqtwebkit-dev

Other Linux distributions might have slightly different package names. Packages for Windows and macOS can be downloaded here: https://download.qt.io/archive/qt/4.8/4.8.7/

In addition, ffmpeg (no developer libs necessary) needs to be installed.

##Compiling
To compile ClipGrab, simply execute the following command:
qmake clipgrab.pro && make

This will create an executable "clipgrab" that you can start via ./clipgrab.
